<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>The following paragraphs are from a common resource document called Lorem Ipsum. It is a bunch
   of Latin. Its purpose is to emulate typical random text to portray format and layout. That is 
   not the point. The point is that I was with relative ease able to produce this webs definition
   files. Some of this is the consolidation of “lessons” from a Udemy web course I just finished.
   I have investigated web coding before but was always put off by the sheer number of editors 
   and tools available. The truth is that a moderately competent understanding of three proved 
   and openly available languages, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, allows one to construct and modify 
   a very useful website. It is not that hard.
